We are delighted to announce that the Skip Developer Program is now available! And for a limited time, we are offering a 50% Early Adopter discount for the first year to businesses who subscribe through this [pricing link](/pricing/?discount=early-adopter). When you become a Skip Early Adopter, your feedback determines where we focus Skip’s rapidly-expanding API support, and your bug reports are our top priorities.

Skip is the only tool that enables you to develop a genuinely native app for *both* major mobile platforms, using the official toolkits from each vendor: SwiftUI on iOS and Jetpack Compose on Android. This means that your apps will look **and** feel native to users. Skip apps are fast and efficient, and they don't suffer from the high memory use and graphical jankiness of other cross-platform solutions.

Skip has been in development for over a year. Since we [announced](/blog/skip-tech-preview/) the technology preview in October, we have had hundreds of eager testers and received valuable feedback from a wide community of app developers. The ability to create a genuinely native app for both iOS and Android using a single codebase – written in a modern language (Swift) and developed with a first-class native IDE (Xcode) – is an exciting prospect for many organizations.

For the first time, a genuinely native app can be developed in a single language using the official toolkits and APIs of both mobile platforms.
