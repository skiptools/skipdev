Skip no longer requires an evaluation license. We are thrilled to announce that Skip is now completely free and open-source!

You can read more about this exciting change in our blog post: [Skip is Free](/blog/skip-is-free/)

While Skip is free to use, we encourage you to support its continued development by visiting our [Sponsor page](/sponsor/). Your contributions help us build the future of Skip!
