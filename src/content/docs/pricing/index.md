## Free and Open Source

Skip is completely free. No license key, no trial period, no revenue threshold, no per-seat pricing. The transpiler, build tools, and all core frameworks are open source under permissive licenses.

Read the full story in our [announcement post](/blog/skip-is-free/).

## How Skip Is Funded

Skip is bootstrapped and community-funded. We have not taken venture capital or private equity investment. This independence means Skip's roadmap is driven by developers, not investors.

Ongoing development — new framework support, performance improvements, tooling, and documentation — is sustained by sponsorships from individuals and companies who use Skip in production.

If Skip saves your team time or money, consider [becoming a sponsor](/sponsor/). Your support directly funds the engineering that keeps Skip moving forward.
