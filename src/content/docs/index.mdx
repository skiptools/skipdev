# How Skip Works

As you write your Swift and SwiftUI source, the Skip Xcode plugin continuously builds the equivalent code for Android. Develop dual-platform libraries or entire apps, with native performance and native user interfaces on both platforms.


## Skip Advantages



<CardGrid>

  <Card title="SwiftUI, All the Way Down" icon="approve-check-circle">
	Write real SwiftUI once and get a first-class native UI on both platforms.
	Skip translates SwiftUI views into Jetpack Compose, preserving layout,
	accessibility, and platform conventions.
	No jank, no outdated interface conventions, no uncanny valley.

  </Card>

  <Card title="No Runtime. No Bloat." icon="cloud-download">
	Skip does it is work at compile time. You get native code all the way down,
      with no managed runtime or heavyweight engine.
	Your iOS app can ship with zero Skip dependencies, and your Android app
	depends only on standard open-source libraries.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Native Performance by Design" icon="magnifier">
	Because Skip apps use real native code, your apps have predictable memory
	usage, fast startup times, and performance characteristics identical to
	hand-written Swift and Kotlin.

  </Card>

  <Card title="First Party IDEs" icon="heart">
	Keep using Xcode as your primary Swift development environment.
	Build, debug, and refactor Swift application and library code exactly as you always have.
	Drop into Android Studio if you want to do heavy platform-specific customization.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Seamless Android Interop" icon="star">
	Need a specific Android SDK or library?
	Skip interoperates cleanly with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, so you can
	integrate Android APIs without fighting the framework.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Open Source, Built for the Long Term" icon="github">
	Skip and its core frameworks are free and open source.
	No lock-in, no proprietary runtimes, and no waiting on vendors to catch up
	with the latest iOS or Android releases.
