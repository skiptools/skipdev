## How Skip Works

As you write your Swift and SwiftUI source, the Skip Xcode plugin continuously builds the equivalent project for Android. Launching your app will open it simultaneously on both the Android emulator and iOS Simulator. On iOS, your app uses direct unintermediated SwiftUI, and on Android it is bridged to the equivalent Jetpack Compose. For both platforms, you get the polish and experience that only the truly native platform SDK can provide. System integration, themes, and accessibility all work "out of the box".

## Skip Advantages

<div class="feature-grid">

  <FeatureCard title="SwiftUI, All the Way Down" icon="widgets" color="blue" link="/docs/modules/skip-ui/#supported-swiftui">
    Write real SwiftUI once and get a first-class native UI on both platforms.
    Skip translates SwiftUI views into Jetpack Compose, preserving layout,
    accessibility, and platform conventions.
  </FeatureCard>

  <FeatureCard title="No Runtime. No Bloat." icon="bolt" color="amber" link="/docs/modes/">
    Skip does all its work at compile time. You get native code all the way down,
    with no managed runtime or heavyweight engine.
    Your Android app depends only on standard open-source libraries.
  </FeatureCard>

  <FeatureCard title="Native Performance by Design" icon="rocket_launch" color="red" link="/docs/project-types/">
    Because Skip apps use real native code, your apps have predictable memory
    usage, fast startup times, and performance characteristics identical to
    hand-written Swift and Kotlin.
  </FeatureCard>

  <FeatureCard title="First Party IDEs" icon="code" color="purple" link="/docs/app-development/">
    Keep using Xcode as your primary Swift development environment.
    Build, debug, and refactor exactly as you always have.
    Drop into Android Studio for platform-specific customization.
  </FeatureCard>

  <FeatureCard title="Seamless Android Interop" icon="sync_alt" color="green" link="/docs/platformcustomization/">
    Need a specific Android SDK or library?
    Skip interoperates cleanly with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, so you can
    integrate Android APIs without fighting the framework.
  </FeatureCard>

  <FeatureCard title="Open Source, Built for the Long Term" icon="lock_open" color="teal" link="/blog/skip-is-free/">
    Skip and its core frameworks are free and open source.
    No lock-in, no proprietary runtimes, and no waiting on vendors to catch up
    with the latest platform releases.
  </FeatureCard>
