## How Skip Works

Your app runs as native SwiftUI on iOS and native Jetpack Compose on Android. There is no intermediary rendering engine — each platform uses its own recommended UI toolkit, so system themes, accessibility, and platform conventions work automatically.

As you develop in Xcode, the Skip plugin continuously builds the Android version alongside iOS. Launch once and see your app running on both the iOS Simulator and Android emulator simultaneously.

## Skip Advantages

<div class="feature-grid">

  <FeatureCard title="SwiftUI, All the Way Down" icon="widgets" color="blue" link="/docs/modules/skip-ui/#supported-swiftui">
    Write your UI once in SwiftUI. On iOS it runs as-is. On Android, Skip
    produces native Jetpack Compose — preserving layout, accessibility, and
    each platform's conventions. No mimicry, no uncanny valley.
  </FeatureCard>

  <FeatureCard title="No Runtime. No Bloat." icon="bolt" color="amber" link="/docs/modes/">
    Skip works entirely at build time. Your shipped app contains no added
    runtime, no embedded engine, and no garbage collector on iOS.
    The result: small binaries and predictable performance.
  </FeatureCard>

  <FeatureCard title="Native Performance by Design" icon="rocket_launch" color="red" link="/docs/project-types/">
    Skip apps launch fast and stay responsive because they are real native
    code — identical in performance to hand-written Swift on iOS and
    hand-written Kotlin on Android. No bridge tax, no frame drops from
    garbage collection pauses.
  </FeatureCard>

  <FeatureCard title="First Party IDEs" icon="code" color="purple" link="/docs/app-development/">
    Stay in Xcode for day-to-day development — your existing workflows,
    shortcuts, and debugging tools all work unchanged. Use Android Studio
    when you need platform-specific tuning.
  </FeatureCard>

  <FeatureCard title="Seamless Android Interop" icon="sync_alt" color="green" link="/docs/platformcustomization/">
    Call any Kotlin or Java API directly from your shared code. Integrate
    Android SDKs, Jetpack libraries, or third-party services without complex
    bridging layers or plugin systems.
  </FeatureCard>

  <FeatureCard title="Open Source, Built for the Long Term" icon="lock_open" color="teal" link="/blog/skip-is-free/">
    Skip is free, open source, and community-funded — no strings attached.
    Your iOS app has zero dependency on Skip, so you can stop using it any time
    without rewriting a single line of iOS code.
  </FeatureCard>
