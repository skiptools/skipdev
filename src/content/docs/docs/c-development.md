One of the advantages of Skip's [native mode](/docs/modes/#native) is the ability to take full advantage of Swift's excellent interoperability with C libraries. But thanks to the magic of Skip's [`skip-ffi`](/docs/modules/skip-ffi/) module, you can interoperate with C in [transpiled mode](/docs/modes/#transpiled) as well! See the [Sharing C code between Swift and Kotlin for iPhone and Android apps](/blog/sharing-c-between-swift-and-kotlin/) blog entry to learn more about using C from transpiled Swift.
