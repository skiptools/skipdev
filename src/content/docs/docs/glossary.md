## Skip-Specific Terms

### Skip {#skip}
A technology that enables iOS developers to build native iOS and Android apps from a single [Swift](#swift) codebase using [SwiftUI](#swiftui). Skip can operate in [Lite](#skip-lite) mode, where it transpiles Swift code to [Kotlin](#kotlin), or it can operate in [Fuse](#skip-fuse) mode, where it uses the [Swift SDK for Android](#ssdk4a) to compile Swift code natively for Android. In both cases, Skip utilizes a SwiftUI to [Jetpack Compose](#jetpack-compose) translation process that produces genuinely native apps for both platforms.

- [Quick Start](/docs/gettingstarted/)

**External Resources:**
- [Skip on GitHub](https://github.com/skiptools/)

### Skip Lite {#skip-lite}
Skip's transpilation mode where Swift code is converted (or [_transpiled_](#transpiler)) to [Kotlin](#kotlin) for Android. Contrast with [Skip Fuse](#skip-fuse), which uses the [Swift SDK for Android](#ssdk4a) to facilitate using compiled Swift for the Android platform. Both modes produce fully native apps.

**Related Terms:** [Skip Fuse](#skip-fuse), [Transpiler](#transpiler), [Skip Zero](#skip-zero)

**Learn More:** [Skip Lite vs. Fuse Documentation](/docs/status/)

### Skip Fuse {#skip-fuse}
Skip's modern app development mode that uses native Swift built with the [Swift SDK for Android](#ssdk4a). Skip Fuse does not have any limitations on Swift language support, but it does lead to larger app sizes.

**Related Terms:** [Skip Lite](#skip-lite)

**Learn More:** [Native and Transpiled Mode](/docs/modes/)

**Related Terms:** [Skip Lite](#skip-lite)

### Ejectability {#ejectability}
When using [Skip Zero](#skip-zero) with [Skip Lite](#skip-lite), _ejectability_ refers to the potential to remove Skip completely from a project and still have fully-functional iOS and Kotlin apps that can be iterated on separately. It de-risks the adoption of Skip by providing an insurance policy for technology developed with Skip that it will continue to be viable going forward even if the project decides against continuing with Skip in the future.

**Related Terms:** [Skip Lite](#skip-lite)

### Transpiler {#transpiler}
A source-to-source compiler that translates code from one programming language to another.

**Related Terms:** [Cross-Platform Development](#cross-platform-development)

### Parity Testing {#parity-testing}
A testing methodology unique to Skip where the same test cases are executed on both iOS (via [XCTest](#xctest)) and Android (via [JUnit](#junit)) to verify identical behavior across platforms. Parity testing ensures that shared business logic produces consistent results on both platforms and helps catch platform-specific bugs early in development. The [Skip CLI](#skip-cli) includes a `skip test` command that runs parity tests and generates a comparison report.

Compared to [Skip](#skip), Flutter has several notable disadvantages:
- **Non-native UI rendering:** Flutter does not use [SwiftUI](#swiftui) or [Jetpack Compose](#jetpack-compose), which can lead to subtle differences in platform behavior, accessibility, and visual fidelity.
- **Additional runtime and engine:** Flutter apps ship with a large runtime and rendering engine, increasing app size and memory usage compared to Skip’s native output.
- **Limited platform integration:** Deep integration with platform-specific APIs often requires writing and maintaining platform “channels” in Swift/Objective-C and Kotlin/Java.
- **Language fragmentation:** Flutter introduces Dart as a third language, whereas Skip allows iOS developers to remain entirely within the Swift ecosystem.

Skip, by contrast, produces genuinely native apps using platform-standard UI frameworks and tooling, with no custom rendering engine and no mandatory additional runtime.

### React Native {#react-native}
A cross-platform mobile development framework created by Meta (Facebook) that allows developers to build apps using JavaScript or TypeScript with a React-based UI model.

Compared to [Skip](#skip), React Native presents several drawbacks:
- **JavaScript bridge overhead:** React Native relies on a bridge (or JSI-based runtime) between JavaScript and native code, which can introduce performance bottlenecks and debugging complexity.
- **Non-native development model:** While React Native renders native views, application logic runs in a JavaScript runtime rather than using platform-native languages like [Swift](#swift) or [Kotlin](#kotlin).
- **Toolchain fragmentation:** Developers must manage Node.js, npm/yarn, Metro, and native build systems in parallel, increasing project complexity.
- **Weaker platform parity:** Platform-specific behaviors, APIs, and UI conventions often require custom native modules and duplicated logic.

Skip avoids these issues by enabling development directly in Swift, integrating tightly with [Xcode](#xcode), producing native SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose UIs, and eliminating any JavaScript runtime or bridge.

### Xamarin {#xamarin}
A cross-platform development framework (now part of .NET MAUI) that allows building iOS and Android apps using C# and .NET. Unlike [Skip](#skip), which uses native UI frameworks ([SwiftUI](#swiftui) and [Jetpack Compose](#jetpack-compose)), Xamarin historically used either native UI bindings (Xamarin.iOS/Android) or a cross-platform UI abstraction (Xamarin.Forms, now .NET MAUI). Xamarin requires developers to learn C# rather than leveraging existing [Swift](#swift) knowledge.

**Contrast With:** [Skip](#skip), [Flutter](#flutter), [React Native](#react-native)

**Related Terms:** [Cross-Platform Development](#cross-platform-development)

**External Resources:**

### Cordova {#cordova}
A mobile application development framework (also known as Apache Cordova or PhoneGap) that enables building apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript running in a WebView. Unlike [Skip](#skip), which produces genuinely [native](#native-development) apps, Cordova apps are essentially web applications wrapped in a native container, resulting in non-native UI, performance limitations, and restricted access to platform capabilities.

**Contrast With:** [Skip](#skip), [Native Development](#native-development)

**Related Terms:** [Cross-Platform Development](#cross-platform-development), [Runtime](#runtime)

## Android and Apple Platforms

Developers familiar with iOS and other Apple platforms use a number of different tools and technologies, such as Swift, Xcode, and SwiftPM. When beginning to work with the Android platform, much of the terminology around Android development may seem alien at first. But in general, each component of iOS development has an analogue in the world of Android development.

Skip handles translating some of these elements between Apple platforms and Android. This table outlines the various Apple-specific terms and maps them to their equivalent Android term, as well as highlighting whether Skip helps in the translation process.
